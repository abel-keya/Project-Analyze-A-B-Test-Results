# Introduction

This repository contains  project work applying Practical inferential statistics and probability to important, real-world scenarios, in analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these

For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.The goal was to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

[Dataset 1](https://github.com/abel-keya/Project-Analyze-A-B-Test-Results/blob/master/ab_data.csv):

In this project i used the **** provided in the workspace .The dataset has the following features:
The dataset contains 6028 records, and 7 columns.
 * user_id
 * timestamp
 * group
 * landing_page
 * converted

[Dataset 2](https://github.com/abel-keya/Project-Analyze-A-B-Test-Results/blob/master/countries.csv):

* user_id	
* country

# CONTEXT

 A/B testing, or split testing, presents 50% of users with an alternate version of a webpage in order to test the effectiveness of a particular variable. A/B tests are evaluated based on whether the alternate page achieves a higher conversion rate. To ensure that results are not impacted by uneven sample sizes, it's important to evenly split both page versions among all visitors (hence the term "split testing").

AB Tests and Conversion Rates
Every page on an ecommerce website promotes a desired action to be taken by visitors, and A/B tests aim to increase the conversion rate of that action. Conversions include:

Buying a product - the primary and most important conversion for an online store
Subscribing to a service
Signing up for a newsletter
Submitting a survey response
