# Introduction

This repository contains  project work applying Practical inferential statistics and probability to important, real-world scenarios, in analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these

For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.The goal was to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

[Dataset 1](https://github.com/abel-keya/Project-Analyze-A-B-Test-Results/blob/master/ab_data.csv):

In this project i used the **** provided in the workspace .The dataset has the following features:
The dataset contains 6028 records, and 7 columns.
 
* price - Price of the house
* bedrooms - Number of Bedrooms
* bathrooms - Number of Bathrooms
* style-the archtectural style of the house
* Neighborhood-the surroundig area where the house located.

[Dataset 2](https://github.com/abel-keya/Project-Analyze-A-B-Test-Results/blob/master/countries.csv):

# Description
I undertook exploratory data analysis by going through the following steps:
* Univariate Analysis
* Bivariate Analysis
* Multivariate Analysis

From the initial plots i discovered that a postive correlation exists between price which can be well handled with Feceted grids. As a result i put in more efforts in Multivariate faceted plot.
 
* There is a strong positive correlation between price,style and area in all the three neighbohood 
* High correlation between area,bathrooms,bedrooms, and price
* The house prices increases with the increase int the number of bedrooms, with the 8 bedrooms having the highest price figure while 1 bedroom has the lowest.This is surprising because the houses with 0 bedroom have higher prices compared to the 1 bedroom house
* There are 3 main house styles which have variation in prices in relation to the Neighborhood and house bedrooms/bathroomsVictorian Style is the most popular with the highest percentage approximately 50%, Ranch is the second most popular house styles with approximately 29.9%, Lodge style is least popular accounting to approximately 20.4 %

* Neighborhood B is the most popular with the highest percentage representation at approximately 40.26%,Neighborhood A follows with * * * approximately 31 % while Neighborhood C is the least popular with approximately 28.6%


# CONTEXT

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# Requirements
* Anaconda installation
* Google colab
* Setup instruction
> * Save a copy of the notebook in your drive and open it to access.
